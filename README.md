# opencl-hello-world
An OpenCL Hello World program that can be used for learning the basics of OpenCL, and actually compiles, checked with OpenCL 1.2 and 2.1 .

Note that if the minimum version is set to 1.2 and the target version 2.1, compilation fails as this issue has not yet been addressed as of the most current commit: https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenCL-CLHPP/issues/108
